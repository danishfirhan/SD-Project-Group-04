Alvvays is fronted by Molly Rankin, who, alongside Kerri MacLellan, grew up in Cape Breton surrounded by fiddles and folk-songs. Their influences include the melancholic sounds of Teenage Fanclub and Belle & Sebastian, all of which drifted across Prince Edward Island to join Alec O'Hanley, Brian Murphy, and Philip MacIsaac.

Recorded at Chad VanGaalen's Yoko Eno studio and mixed by Graham Walsh (Holy Fuck) and John Agnello (Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr., Kurt Vile), the album delivers clear, loud, and shimmering pop tunes that will flood your ears with heart-tugging nostalgia and vibrant melodies.`,
